# Party Zombie

You had so much fun last night, but things didn't go so well. You just woke up the next morning, and felt strange. You find this weird scratch on your hand and wonder what exactly happened yesterday. 

Well, you were scratched last night by a zombie and now you are one too. Oooops!    
You can go out to work and not care about what happened, or you can just stay home and pretend that this is a dream.

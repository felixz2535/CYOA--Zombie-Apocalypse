# Not Going Out

You just stayed home, pretending that this is a dream. However, I hate to break it to you, but this is real. 
You are a **Zombie**, no offense.

You are now hungry and want to eat, not food, but **HUMANS**. You look out the window and you see someone passing by. What would you do? Eat that person or not?
